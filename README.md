# Terraform on VPC Gen2 Test
Just a very simple test to provision to do some vpc tests in IBM Cloud

   - [Announcing IBM Cloud Collection for Ansible](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/ibm-cloud-collection-for-ansible)

Actually the [Getting started with Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-getting-started) explains the flow how to setup a Schematics workspace and how to prepare your environment. However there are a lot of links left and right that fork quickly and might get you off the track and might confuse more than help. 

So just a few escorting hints and essential steps ...

1. Create a [Github account](https://github.com/) to maintain and store your Terraform code
   If you want to use Terraform together with Schematics you have to use Github to link to your Terraform code templates
1. You a fully functional IBM Cloud account. 

   So either upgrade your free Lite Account or someone who geives you access to his account  

   **Don't try to create resources with Terraform/Schematics on a Lite Account!** 

   Even if the `terraform plan` command completes successfully the `terraform apply` command will only make it half way through. 
       It successfuly creates a VPC and security groups and maybe other "free" resources but it gets stuck when creating the actual VSI. It leaves you with a Zombie-VSI that remains in starting state and you will not be able to delete this VM (not with Â´terraform destroy' nor manually through the GUI). The only way to get rid of this undead is to open a ticket and let the 3rd Level support kill him for you.

3. [Install the stand-alone IBM Cloud CLI on your local system](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-install-ibmcloud-cli)

   You usually install the CLI directly on your Laptop but with Windows it comes with a Container environment that conflicts with other Hypervisors you may have installed so I finally decided to install everything on an Ubuntu-based VM (not all Unix derivates are supported by the CLI installer! - Ubuntu works fine , MINT doesn't)  
      
   For the first time use you IBM Cloud ID to log in with specifying the region (you don't need the `-r` option)
   `ibmcloud login --sso -r us-south`
   This involves your web-browser in the log in process to supply you with an access token which needs to be copied back to your CLI. 

   If you want to avoid this web-browser-detour you better [create an API-key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userapikey#create_user_key) for future logins

   `ibmcloud iam api-key-create MyKey -d "this is my API key" --file key_file`
 
   example: `ibmcloud iam api-key-create jsonder -d "Joergs API key" --file js_api_key`

   [logging in with an API-key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-federated_id#federated_id)
   `ibmcloud login --apikey @key_file_name`

   [x] Once you are logged in don't forget to install or update the VPC infrastructure service plug-in.
    `ibmcloud plugin install vpc-infrastructure`
    
    



3. Create your ssh-key pair

    If you haven't done already in the past you have to create an ssh-key-pair and the public part of it has to be uploaded to your account
    
    `ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "jsonderorhoweveryouwanttocallme" -b 2048`

    the "-b 2048" is very important because in my ubuntu system the standard key length is 3072 (standard should be 2048) which is not accepted by IBM Cloud (IBM Cloud accepts the key-lengths 2048 and 4096)
 
    You can upload the public key using the CLI:

    `ibmcloud is key-create jsonder @js_ssh_key2048.pub --resource-group-name default`

    ... or via the IBM Cloud Portal
    
    The [variables.tf](./variables.tf) file in this set contains the name of the default ssh-key. So if you dont want to name your public ssh-key `jsonder` in your Cloud setup you have to edit this file accordingly and replace by your key-name.

**When do you actually need the Command line Interface?**

Actually I don't remember that I really needed the CLI to just execute an existing Terraform templates with Schematics and Github.

Only if you want to change something in the terraform-files you might need to pull some information out of the IBM Cloud. For example I changed the terraform-file which is actually based on the sample code of the [Getting started with Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-getting-started) guide to provision on a Gen2 based VPC instead of Gen1. 
In Gen2 the image names are slightly different (I wouldn't mind but Terraform does :wink: ) so I had to change the image name in [vpc.tf](./vpc.tf). ~~You can not~~ I could not find this imgage name in the GUI but the CLI command `ibmcloud is images` lists all images in the region so that I was able to pick one

```terraform
data ibm_is_image "os" {
  name = "ibm-ubuntu-18-04-1-minimal-amd64-1"
}

resource ibm_is_instance "vsi1" {
  name    = "${local.BASENAME}-vsi1"
  resource_group = "${data.ibm_resource_group.group.id}"
  vpc     = "${ibm_is_vpc.vpc.id}"
  zone    = "${local.ZONE}"
  keys    = ["${data.ibm_is_ssh_key.ssh_key_id.id}"]
  image   = "${data.ibm_is_image.os.id}"
  profile = "bx2-2x8"
```
