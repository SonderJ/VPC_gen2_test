1. other related links

   - [Announcing IBM Cloud Collection for Ansible](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/ibm-cloud-collection-for-ansible)

Actually the [Getting started with Schematics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-getting-started) explains the flow how to setup a a Schematics workspace and how to prepare your environment. However there are a lot of links left and right that fork quickly and are not all necessary and more confusing 

   this page links to a couple of subtask you have to complete if you start on a green field
   - [ ] setting up the playground 
   - [x] setting up CLI for VPC
- create and publish you ssh key
